# PGmigrate

PostgreSQL migrations made easy

## Overview

PGmigrate is a database migration tool developed by Yandex.

PGmigrate has the following key-features:

* **Transactional and nontransactional migrations:** you can enjoy whole power
of PostgreSQL DDL
* **Callbacks:** you can run some DDL on specific steps of migration process
(e.g. drop some code before executing migrations, and create it back after
migrations were applied)
* **Online migrations:** you can execute series of transactional migrations
and callbacks in a single transaction (so, if something goes wrong simple
`ROLLBACK` will bring you in consistent state)

## Install

```
pip install yandex-pgmigrate
```

## Running tests

Tests require running PostgreSQL instance with superuser (to create/drop dbs).
You could setup this yourself and use [tox](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox)
to start tests:
```
tox
```
Second option is to use [docker](https://www.docker.com) and make:
```
make test
```
